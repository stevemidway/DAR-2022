Assignment 5: Infographic
================
DAR
Spring 2022

### Introduction

Each student will produce 1 infographic on a topic of their choosing
(i.e., it could be your own research and a topic you are unfamiliar with
but would like to learn about). **This assignment accounts for 15% of
your course grade.**

### Tips

1.  You all have access to a professional account in
    [Venngage](https://venngage.com/). See the Venngage website and
    video tutorials (in addition to what we will talk about in class)
    for strategies on designing an effective Infographic.

2.  A quick Googling can produce many good examples of infographics.
    Venngage also provides templates and ideas for starting
    infographics.

3.  Regarding content, you may use just about anything. Feel free to use
    something from your database project, your term paper, or your own
    research. Open-source data sets are also available. Finally, I am
    not opposed to creating an infographic that is less based on results
    and more based on methods. Good data analysis relies on good data
    collection, so therefore if you would like to create an infographic
    that is methodological (i.e., *how to*), you may do that with
    instructor permission.

4.  Regardless of the topic you choose, you are required to include 2â€“-3
    quantitative elements represented in your infographic. We discussed
    in class examples of this, but including a single number or
    valuedoes **not** count as a quantitative element. You are **not**
    encouraged to make detailed figures in R, either. Rather, a
    quantitative element is something that conveys quantitative
    information graphically (think: comparisons, ranks, group
    membership, etc.). Please contact me if you have questions about
    what counts as a quantitative element. Your quantitative elements
    constitute a large part of how the assignment will be graded.

### Deliverable

Although you are not required to use Venngage, please let me know if you
plan on using another software. **Upload your Infographic (preferably in
PDF format) by 8am on May 2nd 2022.**

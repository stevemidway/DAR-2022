Assignment 2: Database Development
================
DAR
Spring 2022

### Introduction

In teams of 3, each student will contribute at least one
freely-available ecological database, joined using functions in R, with
other datasets provided by group members. The objective is to create a
new database from merged information. Code and writeup will be produced.
**This assignment accounts for 15% of your course grade.**

### Contents

1.  Identify a group of 3 students. Similar interests may be appealing,
    but consider benefits of others that won’t be competing with your
    data interests.

2.  Discuss the group interests, and what emergent question or analyses
    might arise from datasets you could combine. You don’t necessarily
    need to stick with these questions in the final report, but you do
    need questions to get where you are going.

3.  Individually and as a group, evaluate freely-available data sources
    (see list provided for a start).

4.  Concept map your database as a group. What are the linkages you will
    create among the data files?

5.  Download and join your datasets. Be sure to remove any unnecessary
    data (columns) and have working code.

6.  Provide up to 3 figures that you generated from your database. These
    figures need not be models and can just be exploratory, but they do
    need to be figures and analyses that you could *not* make without
    merging the data.

### Deliverable

Provide a report (one per group) that includes approximately one page
discussing the group interests and motivating questions, along with
where the data were found and how they were evaluated prior to use. At
least one paragraph should be dedicated to each data source going into
the database, and why it was selected and how it was evaluated for
inclusion. Please use data from completely different sources and not
three queries from the same database. (The objective is to merge data
that have never seen each other before.) Include a figure indicating the
different data types and the relationships between them. Include 2–3
pages with one figure per page of the exploratory figures described
above. Include a caption below each figure. Figures will not be graded
on command of figure-making in R, but they should convey the point you
are trying to make. Finally, include code that you used to merge the
datasets and create the figures, such that I could recreate your work.

**This assignment is due by 9am on February 21, 2022. Please submit the
assignment via Box in a Markdown-compiled document that includes code
showing your work, and the names and roles of everyone in your group.**

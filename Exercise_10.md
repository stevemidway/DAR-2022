Exercise 10: Reflection
================
DAR Lab
Spring 2022

For our final lab exercise of the semester, I would like you to write
two paragraphs.

The first paragraph is a self-assessment. Please discuss your personal
goals with the class, identify your own strengths and weaknesses that
perhaps only you know, and consider ideas for what might be next in your
data analytical training. What else do you want or need to learn? What
has this class motivated you to you? What has this class changed in your
research (for better or worse)? This paragraph is intended to be about
YOU and your personal growth in data analytics.

The second paragraph is an objective course assessment. You are welcome
and encouraged to also complete the LSU teaching evaluation, but I often
find the feedback from those forms to be less-than-helpful in really
improving this course. Please be honest and tell me what you liked and
didnâ€™t like. Was the content as advertised? Was the balance of code and
content achieved? Were there too many assignments, or not enough? I can
only improve this course for future students when thoughtful people like
yourselves provide constructive feedback.

**Please upload a document to Box by 9am Friday, May 6th, 2022. The
document may be whatever you like: MS Word, etc.**

Assignment 1: Data Management
================
DAR
Spring 2022

### Introduction

Each student will write either:

1.  Their own Data Management Plan (DMP) detailing the preparation of
    data before (or early in) a project, and handling of data during the
    project, and the long-term curation of the data.

or

2.  A metadata file for an existing dataset, preferably one they are
    using and working with.

You are free to select the document of your choice; however, it is
advised to make this assignment as useful and applied as possible. That
means, if you do not yet have data of your own, consider the DMP that
will help you plan for the data you collect. Or, if you are deeper into
a research project for a data set that does not have metadata, that may
be more useful.

#### For the DMP:

Consider a project for which you are current collecting data, or use a
project that you think would be interesting to do (i.e., you are
designing any project you want to do, but encouraged to connect this to
your research). The larger structure of the data management plan should
consider three phases, preparation before data is collected, handling of
data during collection, and long-term management after the project has
ended.

Contents: Within the structure of before, during, and after, please
address the following specifics to the best of your ability.

-   Briefly outline the purpose of the research
-   Indicate any personnel that will be accomplishing the tasks
-   Any storage and backup plans, including file types and naming
    conventions
-   Budget that would be needed for to carry out the plan
-   QA/QC measures taken on the data
-   How and when you will handle data requests (and data sharing date)
-   Total volume of data generated (consider not just collected data,
    but any simulated data that may arise from the project analyses)
-   Any external data sources that will be linked to your data
-   What will be included in metadata, and at what level will metadata
    be curated
-   Institutional resources for your data

#### For the Metadata Document:

Please use a dataset you are familiar with, but also one that needs
metadata.

Contents: Please include information such as

-   The person recording and/or imputing the data
-   The date of the recording
-   The source of the data
-   A general time and location
-   Specific descriptions of all the column names as well as the column
    data types (data dictionary)
-   Describe units
-   How missing elements are notated

#### A Comment

In some ways, no two metadata files are the same and no two DMPs are the
same–obviously not in content, but also in structure. This variability
is a good thing, but does present a challenge in grading because I do
not want a one-size-fits-all assignment that is easy to grade but less
useful for you. **This assignment is designed to help some aspect of the
data management in your research!** Additionally, you are welcome to
Google for examples of metadata and DMPs–it is good practice to review
all the different versions of documents out there. And you are also
welcome to use a tool (like a Wizard, but not a
[Willard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wizard_(Seinfeld))) for
making one of these documents. Absent a specific list (but see the lists
above) of what to include, please share your assignment with a classmate
for review, because both of these documents are intended to be written
for someone who is not familiar with your data.

#### Deliverable

For either document, I expect that 2–3 pages would be sufficient,
although I am more interested in the content than a specific length. No
figures are required, but if you think a concept map, timeline, or
anything else makes sense, please feel free to include one (or consult
me with questions).

**This assignment accounts for 10% of your course grade.**

**This assignment is due on Box by 5pm on February 11, 2022.**

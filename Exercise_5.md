Exercise 5: ggplot
================
DAR Lab
Spring 2022

This exercise is very straightforward: Create two figures using
`ggplot`.

This is a great opportunity to use your own data set or something that
can serve your own research needs; however, you are welcome to plot
whatever data you would like, including simulated data or data from one
of the many data sets available in R. You are encouraged to try out
different geoms, color scales, and any of the flexibility you would like
to use in `ggplot`.

**To complete this Exercise, please create two figures showing code and
appropriate output. Please upload an RMarkdown-rendered document to Box
by 5pm Tuesday, March 8, 2022. We will go over these in lab on March
9th, so please be prepared to briefly discuss your figures and
intentions for visual communication.**

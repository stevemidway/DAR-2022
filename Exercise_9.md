Exercise 9: Bad Figures
================
DAR Lab
Spring 2022

I know at this point in the semester you have worked hard and worked
through a lot of frustration with code, concepts, etc. The sole
assignment for this lab exercise is to find and submit one or two
examples of what you would consider bad figures. Figures need to come
from the published literature. You can simply copy them into a Word
document, along with a few bullet points about what characteristics you
think make them bad (ineffective).

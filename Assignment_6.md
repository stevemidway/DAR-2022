Assignment 6: Final Project
================
DAR
Spring 2022

### Introduction

As an individual assignment you will write a formal research paper,
focusing on the methods and results. The skills you use will be drawn
from lecture, and data may be your own from your research or any data
you have access and interest in. **This assignment accounts for 25% of
your course grade.**

### Contents

-   5 points: Introduction. Include a paragraph or two of introduction.
    This will likely be much shorter than you would typically write for
    a study, but because the focus of this assignment is on methods and
    results you do not need much introduction. Include just enough to
    familiarize the reader with the topic and importance of your
    forthcoming analysis.
-   20 points: Methods. explain how the data were collected (feel free
    to reference a thesis or other document if it were to get lengthy
    and detailed). Focus on how the data are analyzed—what model(s) were
    considered, what models were eventually selected, how model fit was
    considered, etc. Rely on lecture notes (and/or talk to me) if you
    need ideas for analysis. Please try to use methods we have covered
    in class. You need to include, in statistical notation, the (final)
    model you used.
-   20 points: Results. This section will likely be brief, but please
    describe the results of your analysis. What did the models produce?
    Was there any summary information that helps describe the dataset?
    **Do not interpret your results.** Reference any tables or figures
    that you have made; however, this point allocation will be entirely
    dependent on the text of the Results.
-   20 points: Figures. Create at least 2 figure that were made in R and
    have stand-alone captions. Additional figures and tables are
    welcomed; however, more tables and figures does not necessarily mean
    more points as you will do better with 2 or 3 excellent figures
    instead of 4 or 5 poor figures.
-   5 points: Discussion. Similar to the Introduction, this section is a
    bookend paragraph or two to just close out the document. Please
    interpret your results and return to any themes in your
    Introduction.
-   10 points: Grammar and writing. You have a college education, so it
    is assumed you have taken courses in English and grammar. I do not
    intend to be a stickler on this, but at the graduate level, it is
    expected that you are a proficient writer. Please reference books on
    writing and have classmates, labmates, and/or me review your writing
    if you have any questions.
-   10 points: Code. Finally, include any project code in the last
    section, and call that a Supplement. **Please do not include any
    code in the main document!**
-   10 points: Please select a peer-reviewed journal you may be familiar
    with or would eventually like to submit your research. Use that
    journal’s Guide to Authors to format your paper, and include the
    journal name on the first page so the reader knows where the
    formatting came from.
-   I don’t care much for specific page lengths, but for those curious
    about it, I could see this total assignment being around 5–7 pages.
    I would think around 2 pages each for the methods and results, and
    then a few pages at the end that feature figures. But **I would
    strongly encourage you to focus on addressing the above points and
    not worry about document length.**

### Alternative

If you have a pressing need for some other use of R that you would like
to develop for this assignment, please let me know. I prefer that
students do the writing assignment unless they are strongly motivated to
do some other specific R-based assignment. In other words, do not select
an alternative just because you do not want to write a paper. Some ideas
may be: building a Shiny website, writing an R package, etc. Much of
this will be self-directed, which is why I emphasize the need for
specifics coming from the student.

### Deliverable

Please provide a hard copy of a double-spaced document that includes the
content required and is formatted based on the journal of your choice.
Please also note that the last day I will be available for help on this
assignment is April XX, 2022.

**A digital copy (Word or PDF) of this assignment is due on Box by 5pm
on April 29, 2022.**
